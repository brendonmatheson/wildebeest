/**
 * A MigrationBuilder is a factory component for building instances of {@link Migration}s.  The build method takes the
 * common properties of a Migration as parameters.
 * <p>
 * It's expected that MigrationBuilder's will typically be stateful, with additional properties or configuration
 * information being supplied to them as properties.  The reset() method should be implemented to clear such additional
 * state and restore the MigrationBuilder to a clean state ready to be re-used to build another Migration instance.  The
 * framework will always call reset() before using an MigrationBuilder.
